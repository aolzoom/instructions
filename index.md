## Welcome to The Art of Living Foundation

Dear Sadhak

Jai Gurudeva

Welcome to this wonderful journey called the Art of Living Advanced Meditation Program. Here are a few guidelines that can help you get the best from the program. 

### General Guidelines

1. A Light Sattvik diet is advised on this program. More veggies, less spices, avoiding sugar and maida as much as possible would be a great idea. At the same time, fasting is not advised either, please do make sure you maintain a healthy diet for the duration of the program.
2. Sufficient breaks will be given, so please make sure you hydrate well - suggested to have at least four to five litres of water during the whole day. 

### Guidelines for joining the Zoom Meeting

On the Zoom call, since we have a lot of participants, we will be following a process to admit people into the zoom meeting. 

1. Please ensure you have a zoom account using the same email that you used to register for the course. In case you do not have a zoom account or you have one using some other email address, please [create a zoom account for free at](https://zoom.us/signup) using the same email that you used to register for the course. You can either enter your email address or use your apple, facebook or google account to create your account. In case you use your apple account, please make sure you do not use a dummy email, but your actual email to create the account.
2. Sign in on your zoom app using the user name and password you already had/created in the previous step.
3. Click on the link sent to you to join the zoom meeting. 
4. A volunteer will check your name against the course registration list and let you into the meeting. Please give a few minutes for this to happen. It would be good if you can log in at least ten minutes before the session so we can do this process efficiently before starting the course.
