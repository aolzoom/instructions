## Welcome to The Art of Living Foundation

Dear Sadhak
Jai Gurudeva

Welcome to this wonderful journey called the Art of Living Advanced Meditation Program. Here are a few guidelines that can help you get the best from the program. 

1. A Light Sattvik diet is advised on this program. More veggies, less spices, avoiding sugar and maida as much as possible would be a great idea. At the same time, fasting is not advised either, please do make sure you maintain a healthy diet for the duration of the program.
2. Sufficient breaks will be given, so please make sure you hydrate well - suggested to have at least four to five litres of water during the whole day. 
3. On the Zoom call, since we have a lot of participants, we will be following a process to admit people into the zoom meeting.
